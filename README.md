## üìñ Introduction
The **C Exercises - Archive** is a personal collection of programming exercises in the C language that I have completed over the years during my Programming classes.
This repository represents an effort to organize these exercises in one place.

By making them public, I hope they can serve as a resource for others who are learning or practicing C programming.
Whether you are a student, a self-learner, or someone looking to brush up on C, this archive aims to provide useful exercises for a wide range of programming topics.

## üíª Exercises Usage
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `main` branch of this repository is intended as a personal archive of my exercises. Please do **NOT** modify this branch directly.
> For more details, see the [Contributing and Feedback](#-contributing-and-feedback) section.

To use the exercises in this repository, you can either explore and review my solutions or fork the repository and modify the exercises to practice on your own.

### Steps to Fork the Repository:
1. Open the GitHub page for this repository.
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner.
3. Once the fork is created, clone your forked repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/C-Exercises.git
   ```
4. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd C-Exercises
   ```
5. Browse the folders and choose the exercise you want to practice.

Feel free to customize and modify the exercises to fit your learning goals!

## üìÇ Exercises Structure
The exercises are organized by date, and they become progressively more challenging as the dates increase.
> [!TIP]
> If you are new to C programming, it is recommended to start with the older exercises.

Each folder contains one or more exercises. The task description, prompt, or problem statement is written at the beginning of each `.c` file as a comment to provide context for the exercise.

## ü§ù Contributing and Feedback
