## üìñ Introduction
The **C Exercises - Archive** is a personal collection of programming exercises in the C language that I have completed over the years during my Programming classes.
Initially, these exercises were scattered across various locations: some written on paper, others saved in the cloud, and many stored locally on my computer.

This repository represents an effort to organize these exercises in one place.
By making them public, I hope they can serve as a resource for others who are learning or practicing C programming.
Whether you are a student, a self-learner, or someone looking to brush up on C, this archive aims to provide useful exercises for a wide range of programming topics.

## üìÇ Exercises Structure
The exercises are organized into folders based on categories:
- **Basics**: Simple programs to get familiar with syntax and structure.
- **Control Flow**: Exercises involving loops, conditionals, and branching.
- **Functions**: Problems to practice creating and using functions.
- **Pointers and Memory**: Hands-on practice with pointers and dynamic memory allocation.
- **File Handling**: Reading and writing files in C.

Each folder contains multiple exercises, each with:
- A `README.md` file explaining the problem statement.
- A `.c` file containing the sample solution (if applicable).
